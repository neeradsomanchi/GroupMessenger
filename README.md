GROUP MESSENGER WITH FIFO AND TOTAL ORDERING GUARANTEES

1) Created a group messenger application running on Android Virtual Devices (AVDs).
2) Implemented the ISIS algorithm to ensure total ordering of the messages sent by mutliple AVDs. Designed a recovery mechanism to ensure smooth flow of messages (guaranteeing total ordering) in the event of a crash stop failure of an AVD.
